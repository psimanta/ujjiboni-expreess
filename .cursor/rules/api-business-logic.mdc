# API Endpoints & Business Logic Reference

## Loan Management API

### Core Loan Operations

Based on [src/routes/loan.routes.ts](mdc:src/routes/loan.routes.ts) and [src/controllers/loan.controller.ts](mdc:src/controllers/loan.controller.ts):

#### Loan Creation

- **Endpoint**: `POST /loans`
- **Authentication**: Members only (`requireMemberOnly`)
- **Auto-generates**: Sequential loan number per year (LN2024001, LN2024002, etc.)
- **Required Fields**: principalAmount, monthlyInterestRate, loanType, interestStartMonth, loanDisbursementMonth

#### Loan Retrieval

- **`GET /loans`**: List all loans with filtering (admin/member based)
- **`GET /loans/:id`**: Get specific loan by ID
- **`GET /loans/stats`**: Overall loan statistics
- **`GET /loans/member/stats`**: Member-specific loan statistics

#### Payment Management

- **`POST /loans/:loan/payments`**: Record principal payments (members only)
- **`GET /loans/:loan/payments`**: Get payment history for a loan
- **`POST /loans/:loan/interests`**: Record interest payments (members only)
- **`GET /loans/:loan/interests`**: Get interest payment history

## Business Logic Patterns

### Loan Status Management

From [src/models/Loan.ts](mdc:src/models/Loan.ts):

- **ACTIVE**: Default status for new loans
- **COMPLETED**: Set when principal is fully paid
- Status transitions handled automatically based on payment records

### Interest Calculation System

- **Monthly Interest Rate**: Stored as decimal (e.g., 0.02 for 2%)
- **Interest Start Month**: Format YYYY-MM-01 (e.g., "2024-01-01")
- **Disbursement Month**: When loan was actually given
- **Separate Tracking**: Interest payments tracked separately from principal

### Payment Processing Logic

1. **Principal Payments**: Reduce outstanding loan balance
2. **Interest Payments**: Track monthly interest obligations
3. **Balance Calculation**: Real-time via aggregation of payment records
4. **Payment History**: Chronological record with user attribution

### Loan Number Generation Algorithm

```typescript
// Pattern: LN{YEAR}{0001}
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
const prefix = `LN${currentYear}`;
// Find last loan for current year and increment
const sequence = lastSequence + 1;
return `${prefix}${sequence.toString().padStart(4, "0")}`;
```

## User Management & Authentication

### User Roles & Permissions

From [src/models/User.ts](mdc:src/models/User.ts) and [src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts](mdc:src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts):

#### Admin Capabilities

- Create/update/view all users
- View all loans and transactions
- Access system statistics
- Perform admin-only operations

#### Member Capabilities

- Create loans for themselves
- Record payments (principal and interest)
- View their own loan history
- Update their profile

### Authentication Flow

1. Login via `/auth/login` with email/password
2. Receive JWT token with user info and role
3. Include token in `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
4. Middleware validates token and attaches user to request

## Account & Transaction System

### Account Management

From [src/models/Accounts.ts](mdc:src/models/Accounts.ts):

- Each member has associated accounts
- Tracks balances and account status
- Links to transaction history

### Transaction Recording

From [src/models/Transaction.ts](mdc:src/models/Transaction.ts):

- All financial operations create transaction records
- Multiple transaction types supported
- Audit trail for all financial activities
- Links to accounts and users

## Data Validation Rules

### Date Format Requirements

- All date fields use YYYY-MM-01 format
- Represents first day of the month
- Custom validators enforce this format

### Monetary Values

- All amounts stored as numbers (not strings)
- Positive values enforced via schema validation
- Precision handled at application level

### Text Fields

- Names and descriptions have length limits
- Proper trimming and sanitization
- Optional fields clearly marked

## API Response Patterns

### Successful Operations

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "loan": {
    "_id": "...",
    "loanNumber": "LN20240001",
    "principalAmount": 10000,
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  },
  "message": "Loan created successfully"
}
```

### Error Responses

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "message": "Principal amount must be positive"
}
```

### Pagination Pattern

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "loans": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 25,
    "pages": 3
  }
}
```

## Common Query Patterns

### Finding User's Loans

```typescript
// From Loan model static method
Loan.findByMember(memberId)
  .populate("memberId", "fullName email")
  .populate("enteredBy", "fullName email")
  .sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

### Calculating Outstanding Balance

```typescript
// From Loan instance method
const payments = await LoanPayment.aggregate([
  { $match: { loan: this._id } },
  { $group: { _id: null, totalPaid: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
]);
const outstandingBalance = this.principalAmount - totalPaid;
```

### Loan Statistics

```typescript
// Aggregation for summary statistics
const summary = await Loan.aggregate([
  { $match: matchCriteria },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$status",
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      totalPrincipal: { $sum: "$principalAmount" },
    },
  },
]);
```

## External Service Integration

### Email Service

From [src/services/email.service.ts](mdc:src/services/email.service.ts):

- Loan notifications
- Payment confirmations
- System alerts
- User communication

## Development Environment

### Database Setup

- MongoDB connection via [src/database/connection.ts](mdc:src/database/connection.ts)
- Singleton pattern for connection management
- Proper connection pooling and error handling

### API Documentation

Bruno API files in [api-doc/](mdc:api-doc) provide:

- Request/response examples
- Authentication flows
- Error scenario testing
- Complete API coverage

## Security Implementation

### Password Security

- bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- No plaintext password storage
- Secure password comparison

### JWT Security

- Configurable expiration times
- Secret key from environment variables
- Proper token verification and refresh

### Input Validation

- Schema-level validation via Mongoose
- Custom business rule validation
- SQL injection prevention (MongoDB)
- XSS protection via sanitization
